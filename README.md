# UMCU Uploader

The UMCU Uploader is an application for describing research data sets, preserving them in 
[Archivematica](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/) and publishing them with [Dataverse]( 
https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse).

The University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU) sponsored the development of this application to 
further the objectives of [Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science) and [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) 
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) research data management. 

The application is currently a minimum viable product to provide an end to end process that can be tested with real data sets.

## Overview

The UMCU Uploader is a web-based application that is built using the Python [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) framework. It has been
tested using Python 3.6.9.

### 1 - Describe and Upload Research Dataset 
* Researchers upload a directory of files containing the research data 
* Metadata describing the dataset is added (title, description, related publications, and so on)
* Access rights are assigned to all of the files in the dataset (Public, Restricted or Private)

### 2 - Preserve Research Dataset 
* Metadata is stored in a metadata.json file in a metadata directory (using a standard Archivematica format) 
* The dataset is copied to the Archivematica Transfer Source Directory 
* An Archivematica user can then select the Transfer for transfer and ingest processing in Archivematica, which will create an Archival Information Package (AIP) 

### 3 - Publish Research Dataset 
* The user provides the AIP UUID in the UMCU Uploader application 
* The Uploader will retrieve the AIP from Archivematica (using the Archivematica API) 
* The Uploader will then select files from the AIP that have Public or Restricted Access Rights (any files classified as Private are not published) 
* The Uploader will then upload the dataset to Dataverse (using the Dataverse API) 
* The research data manager will review and approve the dataset before it is visible to public users

[2] The configuration values are single values, except for the `divisions` field.

Example value of the `divisions` setting:

```yaml
---
divisions:
  ed:
    name: Example Division
    transfer_source_directory: /path/to/directory
  ...
```


## Deployment

### Disk space requirements

The application itself, as opposed to application data, should be given 1 GB,
or so, of disk space (providing room for the source code and the application's
SQLite database).

Application data will likely require more disk space. Application data needs to
be manually deleted currently. In order to estimate disk space requirements
this equation can be used: estimated average size of dataset * 3 * estimated
number of datasets (for whatever period of time passes before old application
data is cleaned up).

### Deployment instructions

A fairly simple way of deploying the app is to proxy it through Nginx. This
allows the app to be accessed via TLS/SSL, basic access authentication, etc.

Instructions for deploying using uWSGI proxied through Nginx:

<ol>
<li> Add, to the server block of an Nginx configuration, directives to proxy to WSGI:

```wsgi
location = /uploader { rewrite ^ /uploader/; }
location /uploader { try_files $uri @uploader; }
location @uploader {
  uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/uploader.sock;
  include uwsgi_params;
}
```

<li> Run the app using the included config file:

```bash
$ uwsgi uploader.ini
```

If deploying in Ubuntu you'll likely want to run it using the www-data user:

```bash
$ sudo -u www-data uwsgi uploader.ini
```

<li> Create an application data directory somewhere on your filesystem. This is
where research data uploaded to the app will be put.

If deploying in Ubuntu this directory could be put somewhere like, for
example, `/var/uploader`. You'll want to make this directory
owned by the same user running the app so the app can write data to it.

Example:

```bash
$ sudo mkdir /var/umc-uploader
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/umc-uploader
```

Make sure to set the `data_directory` configuration setting to your chosen
application directory. 
</ol>

### Archivematica integration

The UMC uploader needs to copy research data to Archivematica so that AIPs can
be created from them.

For the UMC uploader to be able to copy to Archivematica transfer source
directories, however, requires that the file permissions on these directories
allow the user that the UMC uploader is running under (likely `www-data` if
running in Ubuntu) to write to them.

If only one Archivematica transfer source directory exists it can be specified
using the `transfer_source_directory` configuration setting. To allow
per-department transfer source directories to be specified then the `divisions`
configuration setting must be populated (see example in `Configuration`
section of this document). 

### Archivematica Storage Service integration

For the UMC uploader to be able to download created AIPs afterwards, before
exporting to Dataverse, requires that Archivematica Storage Service access be
configured.

The following configuration settings must be specified:

* `storage_server_url` (Archivematica Storage Server URL)
* `storage_server_user` (Archivematica Storage Server username)
* `storage_server_api_key` (Archivematica Storage Server API key)

If Archivematica Storage Service is running behind HTTP basic authentication
then the configuration settings must also be specified:

* `storage_server_basic_auth_user` (Archivematica Storage Server basic auth user)
* `storage_server_basic_auth_password` (Archivematica Storage Server basic auth password)

### Dataverse integration

Exporting downloaded AIPs to Dataverse requires the following configuration
options be specified:

* `dataverse_server` (Dataverse server to upload to)
* `dataverse_demo_server` (Demo Dataverse server to upload to)
* `dataverse_api_key` (Dataverse API key)
* `demo_mode` (If `True`, run using demo Dataverse server)

A `divisions.csv` file must also be present in the application directory for
exports to Dataverse to export properly.

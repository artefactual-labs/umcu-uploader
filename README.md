# UMCU Uploader

The UMCU Uploader is an application for describing research data sets, preserving them in 
[Archivematica](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/) and publishing them with [Dataverse]( 
https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse).

The University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU) sponsored the development of this application to 
further the objectives of [Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science) and [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) 
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) research data management. 

The application is currently a minimum viable product to provide an end to end process that can be tested with real data sets.

## Overview

The UMCU Uploader is a web-based application that is built using the Python [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) framework. It has been
tested using Python 3.6.9.

### 1 - Describe and Upload Research Dataset 
* Researchers upload a directory of files containing the research data 
* Metadata describing the dataset is added (title, description, related publications, and so on)
* Access rights are assigned to all of the files in the dataset (Public, Restricted or Private)

### 2 - Preserve Research Dataset 
* Metadata is stored in a metadata.json file in a metadata directory (using a standard Archivematica format) 
* The dataset is copied to the Archivematica Transfer Source Directory 
* An Archivematica user can then select the Transfer for transfer and ingest processing in Archivematica, which will create an Archival Information Package (AIP) 

### 3 - Publish Research Dataset 
* The user provides the AIP UUID in the UMCU Uploader application 
* The Uploader will retrieve the AIP from Archivematica (using the Archivematica API) 
* The Uploader will then select files from the AIP that have Public or Restricted Access Rights (any files classified as Private are not published) 
* The Uploader will then upload the dataset to Dataverse (using the Dataverse API) 
* The research data manager will review and approve the dataset before it is visible to public users

[2] The configuration values are single values, except for the `divisions` field.

Example value of the `divisions` setting:

```
---
divisions:
  ed:
    name: Example Division
    transfer_source_directory: /path/to/directory
  ...
```


## Deployment

A fairly simple way of deploying the app is to proxy it through Nginx. This
allows the app to be accessed via TLS/SSL, basic access authentication, etc.

Instructions for deploying using uWSGI proxied through Nginx:

<ol>
<li> Add, to the server block of an Nginx configuration, directives to proxy to WSGI:

```
location = /uploader { rewrite ^ /uploader/; }
location /uploader { try_files $uri @uploader; }
location @uploader {
  uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/uploader.sock;
  include uwsgi_params;
}
```

 <li> Run the app using the included config file:

```
$ uwsgi uploader.ini
```
</ol>
